I was not much comfortable with the idea and working of the convolutional neural networks. So I decided to use simple Neural Networks (Linear layers) to train my model.

This model consists of 2 hidden layers. the first one consisting 25 neurons and the other one consisting of 15 neurons.

25 and 15 are not completely random numbers. I tried to train the model with various other combinations too, but this seemed the better one.

Training took quite a long time, but at the end I achieved an accuracy of 89.4 %
